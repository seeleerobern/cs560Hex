# cs560Hex
For program to find shortest path in hex grid
</br>Instructions:
</br>1: Download and open SourceTree (you can do this with command line but I think sourcetree is easier)
</br>2: In SourceTree, click "Clone/New" button in the top left
</br>3: Where it says "Source Path/ URL" put https://github.com/MichaelMilstead/cs560Hex
</br>4: Whatever you pick as "destination path" will be where the project is put on your computer
</br>5: Click "Clone" and you should have the project.
</br>
</br>Before editing code, always click the "Pull" button in sourcetree. This makes sure you have the most up-to date code before editing.
</br>To upload code to Github so everybody has your new code:
</br>1: Click the "commit" button in sourcetree, and then "stage all", and then the commit button at the bottom right. You can add a message about your code edits in the textbox there.
</br>2: Click "Push" button at the top of sourcetree. Then click the "push" button in the popup window.
